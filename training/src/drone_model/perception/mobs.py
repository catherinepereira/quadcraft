Mobs the drone has seen lately and their kinds. Pixels the mask calls a mob (the mod's mask, or the block reader's
classes mapped into mask ids) are back-projected through depth and grouped into mobs, one kind at a time. Hits that land
in cells the drone's voxel memory has as solid blocks are dropped first: the reader's mob outline spilling onto the
ground, or the reader misreading a block. Each mob stays where it was last seen until the camera looks at that spot and
sees past it or sees a block there, or it goes unseen for a long while
