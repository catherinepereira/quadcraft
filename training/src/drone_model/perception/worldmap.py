"""
The free space the drone flies through, part of its perception core (perception.core). Each frame's depth and
semantic mask are back-projected into world points. A hit below the camera raises that column's known floor, a hit
above it lowers the column's known ceiling, and a ray that crosses a cell shows it empty. Other drones block their
column for a few frames, they move. Which block fills each cell is the voxel memory's (perception.memory)
