"""
The planner for patrol and guard jobs and their arenas. It sweeps the region's patrol cells row by row, round after
round. With hunt it breaks off for any of its prey it sees inside the region (hostile mobs, every mob, or the kinds the
job names), closes to beam range, and holds the beam on it until it's down. With none in sight it first goes back to
look where prey was last seen, and after each sweep round it looks over the region from above its middle. It's never
told how many prey there are, a hunt arena ends once none is left.
In vision perception mobs come from the camera through perception.mobs, in scan perception the job hands them over
